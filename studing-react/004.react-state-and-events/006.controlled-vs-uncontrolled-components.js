    Whenever you use two way binding you are controlling a component.

    It means that a value which is used in the child component is passed on through props
    and is received from the parent component.

    The parent component is really just a component that presents the UI, and then attaches a couple
    of listeners or props, but the real logic resides in the parent component. That turns the child
    component in a controlled component.

    Other terms you should be aware of because you might hear it from time to time are
    presentational versus stateful components
    stateless versus stateful components
    dumb versus smart components.
