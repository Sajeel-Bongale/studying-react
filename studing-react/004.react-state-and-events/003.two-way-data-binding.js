    Two way data binding allows us to attach state to an input value.

    With this, when the input value changes, the state updates and when the state value changes it
    in turn triggers an update on the input.

    This is useful when using forms/inputs.

    To achieve this create the state and bind it to the change handlers of the inputs and then
    add a value attribute to the same input element.

    Now when the input is updated from the UI, the model changes because of the change handler.
    When the state value changes it updates the input element on the UI through this value property.
