    React is a Javascript library used for building user interfaces.

    As against old applications which were required to make a new request to fetch updated pages
    every time an update was required, JS allows the user to make smaller requests to fetch
    only that change parts of the page.

    JavaScript in the browser is able to manipulate to so-called Dom, the HTML elements
    that are rendered onto the screen. We can manipulate this with JavaScript.
    And that allows us to change what the users sees without fetching a new HTML page.

    However the entirety of this functionality is provided by JS and it can be achieved without the
    need for ReactJS.

    React powers websites to be fluid, responsive and Reactive. It makes the app look and feel like
    a mobile app with smooth transitions and highly reactive user experience.

    React is all about splitting your application into small building blocks, small components,
    where every building block, every component, has a clear task and therefore your code
    stays maintainable and manageable and React, the library, will do the heavy lifting
    of rendering something on the screen and of combining all your code.

    It helps simplify instructions which end up changing and reacting to the events in the DOM

    We, as a React developer, work on a higher level, which makes working with React and which makes
    building complex user interfaces way easier.

    And it does so, by giving us a higher level syntax, where we write code
    in a declarative and component-focused way.
