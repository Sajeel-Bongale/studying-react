    Since displaying of component lists rely on the array of elements that are passed from the parent,
    any updates to the array should trigger a change in the UI.

    However, as seen previously an update on a regular variable does not trigger a change in the UI. To do
    so, we must add a state to the app.

    This list, which is used for rendering the elements should be made into a state variable, so that
    updates reflect on the UI too.

    Simply use the methods defined in the 004.react-state-and-events/002.state.js file to update the
    state in the parent component.
