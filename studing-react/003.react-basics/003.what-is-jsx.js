    JSX code is basically HTML code inside of JavaScript.

    JSX stands for JavaScript XML

    JSX only works because there are transformation steps running behind the scenes which convert the JSX
    into browser readable JS code.

    You can see this code in the developer tools in the browser. Open the sources tab and under the static
    folder you will find the compiled and transformed code. It does not look anything like the code written
    in the editor but it is actually all your code combined with the react library code that is sent.

    You can search for your App function in here and you will find that your code has been replaced with
    more complex code which is now browser readable.

    Thus JSX provides the developer with ease of writing HTML in JS without bothering what and how it
    gets compiled into resulting pages/components.
