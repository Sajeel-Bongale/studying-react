    What exactly are components?
    Components are reusable building blocks (made out of HTML, CSS and JS) that are used to create a UI.

    Components promote:
    1. Re-usability of code.
    eg. You create one component like a card and use it everywhere in your application with only
    internal data changing. This helps to implement the DRY(Do Not Repeat Yourself) principle.

    2. Separation of concerns
    Since components are small sized chunks of code, they take care of only one particular aspect
    or area of concern. This small piece of code works independently and can be maintained
    separately as compared to other components. This helps to keep the code simple (KISS principle).

    React uses something which is called a declarative approach for building these components in
    which you have to specify the end state of the components and the library takes care of creating,
    updating and destroying them. You don't have to write the DOM specific code that does these tasks.
