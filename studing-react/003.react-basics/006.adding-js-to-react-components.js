    You can simplify the code in your component by extracting complex logic from the return value(HTML content)
    and place separately above the return statement or at the beginning of the function.

    This helps keep the HTML lean and clean.

    At the same time, your business logic remains in separate functions or simple statements that can
    be easily tested at a later time.
